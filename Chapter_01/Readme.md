All of the offenses from ex1.rb were about using double quotes instead of single quotes. single quotes are preferred when string interpolation or special characters are not required. 
I fixed this by changing the double quotes to single quotes. 
I don't think using it makes a difference in the examples in ex1.rb, just more of a convention.
