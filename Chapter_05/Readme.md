[here] (http://will-bloggs-too.com/2013/12/01/ruby-format-sequence/) is a link to all the ruby format sequences.

running guard on ex_5.rb gives a lot of offences. I don't understand this one:
Favor format over String#%.

It also suggests I separate every 3 digits of an integer with an underscore, eg 234432 => 234_432
 
is there a way to tell guard that I want it to ignore a particular rule, or a particular instance of a rule?
