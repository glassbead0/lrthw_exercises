Questions:
What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
1) reading and writing
2) attention to detail
3) spotting differences

Please explain these three skills in your own words.
1) reading and writing code means knowing the meaning of various symbols (not usually used in everyday writing), and being able to type all those symbols fluently
2) the devil is in the details. I (and I'm sure nearly every programmer) have spent inordinate amounts of time searching for what turned out to be a missing semi-colon, or a misspelled word, that crashes the entire program. 
3) Spotting differences means looking at two relatively similar blocks of code, and noticing exactly where they differ. 

Why do you need to not copy and paste?
For the same reason that I used to tell my students that they could not take a picture of my notes on the board, but they had to hand write them down. You learn by doing. Just copy-pasting does not rewire your neurons like typing does.
