I used single quotes instead of double quotes, and this was fine everywhere except in line 4, where I define months.
I'm guessing the escape backslash \ only works with double quotes

I would use print instead of puts to get the to print on the same line. However, it then prints the next statement on that same line too. 
I tried two different fixes:
print 'The days are: ', days, "\n"
or just put a blank puts line before the next puts
